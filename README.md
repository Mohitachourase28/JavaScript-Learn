- Practiced array methods to manipulate data:  
  - **push()**: Adds an element to the end of an array.  
  - **pop()**: Removes the last element of an array.  
  - **unshift()**: Adds an element to the beginning of an array.  
  - **shift()**: Removes the first element of an array.  
- Implemented examples to understand array operations.  

---

### 5. **Spread and Rest Operators**

    console.log(...numbers); // Output: 1 2 3  
    ```  
- Studied the **rest parameter (`...rest`)**:  
  - Bundles multiple arguments into an array.  
  - Example:  
    ```javascript  
    function sum(...rest) {  
      return rest.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0);  
    }  
    console.log(sum(1, 2, 3)); // Output: 6  
    ```

# JavaScript Advanced Concepts: Filter, Reduce, Function Expressions, and More

This project highlights my learning journey through advanced JavaScript concepts, such as array methods (`filter` and `reduce`), function expressions, callbacks, higher-order functions, closures, event listeners, arrow functions, and objects. Each topic includes examples to demonstrate their practical usage.

---

## Topics Covered

### 1. **`.filter()` Method**
- Creates a new array by filtering out elements based on a condition provided in a callback function.

#### Example:
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter((num) => num % 2 === 0);
console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6]

const words = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"];
const longWords = words.filter((word) => word.length > 5);
console.log(longWords); // Output: ["banana", "cherry"]
```

---

### 2. **`.reduce()` Method**
- Reduces the elements of an array into a single value by applying a callback function iteratively.

#### Example:
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const sum = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue, 0);
console.log(sum); // Output: 10

const product = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator * currentValue, 1);
console.log(product); // Output: 24
```

---

### 3. **Function Expressions**

#### Function Declaration
- Defines a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.

#### Example:
```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
console.log(greet("Alice")); // Output: Hello, Alice!
```

#### Function Expression
- A way to define functions as values or variables.

#### Example:
```javascript
const greet = function(name) {
  return `Hi, ${name}!`;
};
console.log(greet("Bob")); // Output: Hi, Bob!
```

---

### 4. **Other Key Concepts**

#### **Callbacks in Asynchronous Operations**
- Functions passed as arguments to handle operations that take time to complete.

#### Example:
```javascript
function fetchData(callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Data fetched.");
    callback();
  }, 2000);
}
function processData() {
  console.log("Processing data...");
}
fetchData(processData);
```

#### **Higher-Order Functions**
- Functions that accept other functions as arguments or return them as results.

#### Example:
```javascript
function higherOrder(func) {
  func();
}
higherOrder(() => console.log("Hello from a higher-order function!"));
```

#### **Closures**
- Functions that "close over" their lexical environment, retaining access to variables defined outside their scope.

#### Example:
```javascript
function outerFunction(outerVariable) {
  return function innerFunction(innerVariable) {
    console.log(`Outer: ${outerVariable}, Inner: ${innerVariable}`);
  };
}
const closure = outerFunction("outside");
closure("inside"); // Output: Outer: outside, Inner: inside
```

#### **Event Listeners**
- Functions that respond to user interactions or events.

#### Example:
```javascript
const button = document.querySelector("button");
button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("Button clicked!");
});
```

---

### 5. **Arrow Functions**
- A concise way to write function expressions. Ideal for simple functions used once.

#### Syntax:
```javascript
(parameters) => some code
```

#### Example:
```javascript
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(add(2, 3)); // Output: 5

const greet = (name) => `Hello, ${name}!`;
console.log(greet("Charlie")); // Output: Hello, Charlie!
```

---

### 6. **Objects**
- A collection of related properties and/or methods. Can represent real-world entities like people, products, or places.

#### Example:
```javascript
const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  greet: function() {
    console.log(`Hi, I'm ${this.name} and I'm ${this.age} years old.`);
  }
};
person.greet(); // Output: Hi, I'm Alice and I'm 30 years old.

const product = {
  name: "Laptop",
  price: 1000,
  details() {
    console.log(`${this.name} costs $${this.price}.`);
  }
};
product.details(); // Output: Laptop costs $1000.
```
