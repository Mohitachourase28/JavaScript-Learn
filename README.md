# JavaScript Basics

This project covers the foundational concepts of JavaScript including variables, data types, arithmetic operations, and user input handling.

## Key Concepts:

- **JavaScript Template Literals**: Used for string interpolation.
- **Window Methods**:
  - `window.alert()`: Displays an alert to the user.
  - `window.prompt()`: Collects user input through a prompt dialog.
- **DOM Manipulation**:
  - `getElementById`: Accesses HTML elements by their ID.
  - `textContent`: Updates the text content of elements.
  
## Concepts Studied:

- **Variables & Data Types**: Numbers, strings, and `const` variables.
- **Arithmetic Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.
- **Operator Precedence**: The order in which operations are executed.
- **Type Conversion**: Converting values between different types.
  
## Math Object Methods:

- `Math.round()`, `Math.floor()`, `Math.ceil()`, `Math.trunc()`, `Math.pow()`, `Math.sqrt()`, `Math.log()`
- Trigonometric Methods: `Math.sin()`, `Math.cos()`, `Math.tan()`
- Other Methods: `Math.abs()`, `Math.sign()`

# Random Number Generator and JavaScript Basics  

This project is a collection of JavaScript concepts and examples I studied and implemented to strengthen my understanding of the language. Here's an overview of the topics covered:  

---

## Features  

### 1. **Random Number Generator**  
- Implemented a function that generates a random number using a specified `min` and `max` value.  

---

### 2. **If Statements**  
- Learned how to use `if` statements to execute code based on conditions.  
- Practiced examples of handling scenarios where:  
  - A condition is true, and specific code is executed.  
  - If not, alternate code is executed.  

---

### 3. **Checkbox `.checked` Property**  
- Studied the `.checked` property in HTML. This property determines whether a checkbox or radio button element is checked.  
- Implemented a **payment modes** example where users could select their payment method (Visa, MasterCard, or PayPal).  

---

### 4. **Ternary Operator**  
- Explored the ternary operator, a shortcut for `if...else` statements.  
- Syntax:  
  ```javascript
  condition ? codeIfTrue : codeIfFalse;

# JavaScript Concepts and Number Guessing Game  

This project showcases my learning journey through essential JavaScript concepts, including string manipulation, logical operators, equality operators, loops, and the creation of a **Number Guessing Game**.  

---

## Topics Covered  

### 1. **String Slicing**  
- Studied how to create substrings using the `String.slice(start, end)` method.  
- Practiced examples to extract specific parts of a string.  

---

### 2. **Method Chaining**  
- Learned about **method chaining**â€”calling multiple methods in a single continuous line of code.  
- Compared using method chaining and not using it to observe differences in code readability and efficiency.  

---

### 3. **Logical Operators**  
- Explored operators used to combine or manipulate boolean values (`true` or `false`):  
  - **AND (`&&`)**: All conditions must be true.  
  - **OR (`||`)**: At least one condition must be true.  
  - **NOT (`!`)**: Negates a boolean value.  
- Practiced examples to solidify understanding.  

---

### 4. **Equality and Comparison Operators**  
- Studied the following operators with examples:  
  - `=`: Assignment operator (assigns a value to a variable).  
  - `==`: Comparison operator (checks if values are equal).  
  - `===`: Strict equality operator (checks if values and data types are equal).  
  - `!=`: Inequality operator (checks if values are not equal).  
  - `!==`: Strict inequality operator (checks if values and data types are not equal).  

---

### 5. **Loops**  
- Explored different types of loops for repeating code:  
  - **While Loop**: Repeats code as long as a condition is true.  
  - **Do-While Loop**: Executes code at least once, then repeats while the condition is true.  
  - **For Loop**: Repeats code a limited number of times.  
- Practiced with various examples to understand their behavior and use cases.  

---

### 6. **Number Guessing Game**  
- Created a fun and interactive **Number Guessing Game** that incorporates:  
  - Random number generation.  
  - Conditional statements.  
  - Loops for repeated guesses.  
  - Logical and comparison operators for game logic.  

---

## Lessons Learned  
- The significance of slicing and chaining methods to manipulate and enhance strings efficiently.  
- Logical operators and equality operators provide the backbone of decision-making in JavaScript.  
- Loops are essential for executing repetitive tasks effectively.  
- Building projects like the **Number Guessing Game** helps apply concepts in a practical and engaging way.
