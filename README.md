# JavaScript Practice Projects

## [01_jsPract1](./01_jsPract1/)

### **Description**
This folder contains a project exploring fundamental JavaScript concepts and their practical applications. Below is a detailed summary of the topics covered.

---
### **Key Topics and Concepts**

1. **JavaScript Basics**
   - Utilized template literals for cleaner string interpolation.
   - Used `window.alert` to display messages.
   - Manipulated HTML with `getElementById` and `textContent`.

2. **Variables and Data Types**
   - **Variables**: Used to store values and act as placeholders.
   - **Data Types**: Explored numbers, strings, and their roles in programming.

3. **Arithmetic Operators**
   - Learned operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.
   - **Operator Precedence**:
     1. Parentheses `()`
     2. Exponents
     3. Multiplication, Division, Modulus
     4. Addition, Subtraction

4. **User Input**
   - The easy way: `window.prompt`.
   - The professional way: HTML textboxes.

5. **Type Conversion**
   - Converting values from one data type to another (e.g., string to number, number to boolean).

6. **`const` Variables**
   - Studied immutability and when to use `const` in place of `let`.

7. **Practical Example**
   - Created a counter program to understand basic increment/decrement logic.

8. **Math Object**
   - Common methods:
     - `Math.round(x)`: Rounds to the nearest integer.
     - `Math.floor(x)`: Rounds down to the nearest integer.
     - `Math.ceil(x)`: Rounds up to the nearest integer.
     - `Math.trunc(x)`: Removes the decimal part, returning the integer.
   - Advanced methods:
     - `Math.pow`, `Math.sqrt`, `Math.log`.
     - Trigonometric functions: `Math.sin`, `Math.cos`, `Math.tan`.
   - Other utilities:
     - `Math.abs`: Returns the absolute value of a number.
     - `Math.sign`: Returns the sign of a number (positive, negative, or zero).

### **How to Use**
1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser to see the project in action.
2. Review the JavaScript code in the `script.js` file for implementation details.

### **Takeaways**
This project serves as a hands-on approach to learning the basics of JavaScript, including core concepts, user input handling, and mathematical operations.
